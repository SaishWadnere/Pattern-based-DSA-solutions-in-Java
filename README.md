# 📘 DSA Solutions in Java

Hello! I’m **Saish Wadnere**, a **Second-Year B.Tech (Computer Science) student** at **Sandip Institute**.  
I am passionate about **Cloud Computing** and **Cybersecurity**, and I solve DSA questions regularly to build strong problem-solving skills.

This repository contains my **Java solutions for DSA problems**, mainly from platforms like **LeetCode**.  
I only solve questions here — **no custom data-structure implementations**, just pure problem-solving in Java.
